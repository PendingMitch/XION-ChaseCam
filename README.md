# Axon Body 2
This is a fork of the Axon XION Chase Cam from zhivotnoya. This will develop a file that creates an overlay video for video edits. You enter your starting time, date and how many minutes you would like to pass during the video. It creates it with an aqua background to be not to close to the yellow and not too close to the black - this is to be used with a masking key in an editing software. The html file has the css, html, and javascript all in one file for ease of editing. 

# How to use:

1) Hit the Overlay.exe under dist. - Alternatively use Python310 to launch the main.py file in the src directory.
